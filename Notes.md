* GitHub

* Repository
The codebase
This is the collected repository of changes(commits), which might be different between different places (local, github, other machines).

* Remote
Any other repository which you have access to. Conventionally this is just the one cloudbased repo.  It's conventionally referred to as "origin".

* Local
The repository you are working "in".

* Commit
A collected set of changes. This is a very "atomic" unit in git.

* Push
Pushing your commits(changes) to another repository (This is often/ususally "origin", on the specified "main" repository (This is often for example hosted on GitHub))

* Pull
Pulling changes from another repository. (Again, this is often/usually "origin" from the cloud based "main" repository)
